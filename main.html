            <p>
                In a future where Earth is ravaged by a global crop blight and massive dust storms, 
                humanity is on the brink of extinction. A team of astronauts, led by former pilot 
                Joseph Cooper, travels through a mysterious wormhole near Saturn to find a new 
                habitable home for the human race in a distant galaxy.

                "We've always defined ourselves by the ability to overcome the impossible. 
                And we count these moments. These moments when we dare to aim higher, to 
                break barriers, to reach for the stars, to make the unknown known. 
                We count these moments as our proudest achievements."
